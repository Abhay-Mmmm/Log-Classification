# Log Classification With Hybrid Classification Framework

This project implements a hybrid log classification system, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

## Classification Approaches

1. **Regular Expression (Regex)**:
   - Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
   - Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

2. **Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression**:
   - Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
   - Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.

3. **LLM (Large Language Models)**:
   - Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
   - Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.

## Folder Structure

1. **`training/`**:
   - Contains the code for training models using Sentence Transformer and Logistic Regression.
   - Includes the code for regex-based classification.

2. **`models/`**:
   - Stores the saved models, including Sentence Transformer embeddings and the Logistic Regression model.

3. **`resources/`**:
   - This folder contains resource files such as test CSV files, images, etc.

4. **Root Directory**:
   - Contains the Streamlit server code (`server.py`).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   To start the interactive log classification app, use the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run server.py
   ```

   This will open a web interface in your browser where you can input log sources and log messages for classification.

## Usage

Use the Streamlit web interface to classify logs one at a time:
- Enter the `source` (e.g., `LegacyCRM`, `ModernCRM`, etc.).
- Enter the `log_message` you want to classify.
- Click the **Classify Log** button to see the predicted label for your log message.

The result will be displayed directly in the browser.
